It's pretty cool! Menudle will wrap this long line to 72 characters per line (but that's configurable if you're prefer something else!).\n\n    :underline Some features\n\n    You can do a lot of stuff with Menudle. You may notice that this text doesn't need anything special; it's rendered as text.\n\n    :link 0 localhost:70/guide.txt Check out this cool guide\n\n    The above will be formatted as a link and it'll actually work! You can leave off the port if it's 70, Menudle will fill it in for you:\n\n    :link 0 localhost/something.txt No need for the port!\n\n    It's not recommended, but you can leave off the link type and Gopher will try to figure it out for you:\n\n    :link localhost/guide.txt It's a .txt, so it's a \"0\"\n    :link localhost/pancakes.gif It's a .gif, so it's a \"g\"\n    :link gopherpedia.com/ It's a root, so it's a \"1\"\n    :link http://evanhahn.com/ It's HTTP(S), so it's of type \"h\"\n\nAnd then render it:\n\n    var menudle = require('menudle')\n    response = menudle(myString)\n\nAnd you're done! Happy building of Gopher menus.",
